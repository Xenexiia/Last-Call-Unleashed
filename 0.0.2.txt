```Removed Section!
-Removed Homemade RPG (Before I get flak for removing the HmRPG, I'll be balancing the original RPG to be less Overpowered, this one is not required any longer!)
-Removed "angelicMosen" (I felt if we kept this and the Kar98K, it would feel like Copy-Pasta, so I got rid of the gun that not as many people really know or like, if I get enough popular demand I'll re-add the Mosen)
-Removed the AoE aspect of Bandages,First-Aids,Energy drinks,Painkillers and Med-kits! (You cannot heal your friends with these consumable items anymore, only yourself!)
-Removed Warmachine, replaced by China Lake (Balance)```

```Reworks Section!
⌖Reworked Grenades
    ⌖Tacticals are now in their own category, you can now carry up to two (2) tactical grenades on your hot-bar and one lethal. This should slow down the grenades from being the most used consumable item.
⌖Reworked some uniques from the Original Last Call PvP
    ⌖Reworked the "ViperSniper"
        ⌖Viper Sniper now deals only half a heart of damage, however poisons the target for two whole minutes!
    ⌖Reworked the "SQTranquilzer"
        ⌖The SQTranq now only slows you down by 50% it no longer immobilizes you (I felt this could be easily abused by players with better accuracy in terms of hitting a player with the SQT then switching to a higher caliber weapon for a one shot headshot, this should prevent that!)
    ⌖Reworked "Deomonic Curse"
        ⌖The demonic curse used to one shot. It should now deal roughly four hearts with initial hit, then another half with explosion, the rest will be done with fire DoT!
    ⌖Reworked Energy Sniper
        ⌖Basically you can't shoot through as many walls anymore, only one, Damage was greatly reduced
    ⌖Reworked Berserker's Blast
        ⌖This weapon now has an underbarrel mounted Rifle, its only got one bullet! Make it count!
        ⌖I've also made it a pump-action, it was dominating Subs and AR's at close range, we're reduced the possibility for that to happen!
    ⌖Reworked Hellfire Blunderbus
        ⌖This will be the only fire shotgun we have for a while, it's been nerfed, most damage comes from the flames, that's how I've decided to balance the old "demonic" weapons
    ⌖Reworked Rift-E9
        ⌖Reduced the ability to one burst (I felt it was just a tad more powerful than I wanted it to be, it should now only one burst if at least one projectile hits the head!)
        ⌖Also I'd like to mention I changed the particles on all the energy weapons, this one has blue particles when you shoot, for muzzleflash!
    ⌖Reworked The Redeemer
        ⌖What else to say? Most of the damage is from the fire DoT, nerfed the magazine size down to 6 from 16```
